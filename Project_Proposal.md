Question/need:
The framing question of my analysis will be: Given previously released movies, which movies should I invest in? Potential Future Film Investors will benefit from my model. 
Data Description:
The dataset I will be using is Box Office Mojo. An individual sample is a specific movie release page. Features I will add to my dataset are: MPAA, Director, Actors, Gross Pay Domestic, Budget, Distributor, Genre, Widest Release, Running Time, (and probably a couple more). I
 think my target will be any movies that have a gross pay at least twice as much as their budget as the potential movies to invest in. 
Tools:
I donâ€™t plan on needing any additional tools and I will meet the basic tools requirement of the project. 
MVP Goal:
Webscrape and compare the features of only 20 movie releases instead of 1000.
